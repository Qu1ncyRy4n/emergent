// TimeScales are the different time scales associated with overall simulation running, and
// can be used to parameterize the updating and control flow of simulations at different scales.
// The definitions become increasingly subjective imprecise as the time scales increase.
// Environments can implement updating along different such time scales as appropriate.
// This list is designed to standardize terminology across simulations and
// establish a common conceptual framework for time -- it can easily be extended in specific
// simulations to add needed additional levels, although using one of the existing standard
// values is recommended wherever possible.

	// Event is the smallest unit of naturalistic experience that coheres unto itself
	// (e.g., something that could be described in a sentence).
	// Typically this is on the time scale of a few seconds: e.g., reaching for
	// something, catching a ball.  In an experiment it could just be the onset
	// of a stimulus, or the generation of a response.
	Event = TimeScales(etime.Event)

	// Trial is one unit of behavior in an experiment, and could potentially
	// encompass multiple Events (e.g., one event is fixation, next is stimulus,
	// last is response, all comprising one Trial).  It is also conventionally
	// used as a single Input / Output learning instance in a standard error-driven
	// learning paradigm.
	Trial = TimeScales(etime.Trial)

	// Tick is one step in a sequence -- often it is useful to have Trial count
	// up throughout the entire Epoch but also include a Tick to count trials
	// within a Sequence
	Tick = TimeScales(etime.Tick)

	// Sequence is a sequential group of Trials (not always needed).
	Sequence = TimeScales(etime.Sequence)

	// Block is a collection of Trials, Sequences or Events, often used in experiments
	// when conditions are varied across blocks.

	// Condition is a collection of Blocks that share the same set of parameters.
	// This is intermediate between Block and Run levels.
	Condition = TimeScales(etime.Condition)

	// Epoch is used in two different contexts.  In machine learning, it represents a
	// collection of Trials, Sequences or Events that constitute a "representative sample"
	// of the environment.  In the simplest case, it is the entire collection of Trials
	// used for training.  In electrophysiology, it is a timing window used for organizing
	// the analysis of electrode data.
	Epoch = TimeScales(etime.Epoch)

	// Run is a complete run of a model / subject, from training to testing, etc.
	// Often multiple runs are done in an Expt to obtain statistics over initial
	// random weights etc.

	// parameters.
	Expt = TimeScales(etime.Expt)

	// Scene is a sequence of events that constitutes the next larger-scale coherent unit
	// of naturalistic experience corresponding e.g., to a scene in a movie.
	// Typically consists of events that all take place in one location over
	// e.g., a minute or so. This could be a paragraph or a page or so in a book.
	Scene = TimeScales(etime.Scene)
