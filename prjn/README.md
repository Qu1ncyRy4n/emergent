Package prjn is a separate package for defining `Pattern`s of connectivity between layers (i.e., the ProjectionSpecs from C++ emergent).  This is done using a fully independent structure that *only* knows about the shapes of the two layers, and it returns a fully general bitmap representation of the pattern of connectivity between them.

The algorithm-specific leabra.Prjn code then uses these patterns to do all the nitty-gritty of connecting up neurons.

This makes the projection code *much* simpler compared to the ProjectionSpec in C++ emergent, which was involved in both creating the pattern and also all the complexity of setting up the actual connections themselves.  This should be the *last* time any of those projection patterns need to be written (having re-written this code too many times in the C++ version as the details of memory allocations changed).

A Pattern maintains nothing about a specific projection -- it only has the parameters that are applied in creating a new pattern of connectivity, so it can be shared among any number of projections that need the same connectivity parameters.

All Patttern types have a New<Name> where <Name> is the type name, that creates a new instance of given pattern initialized with default values.

Individual Pattern types may have a Defaults() method to initialize default values, but it is not mandatory.

# Topographic Weights

Some projections (e.g., Circle, PoolTile) support the generation of topographic weight patterns that can be used to set initial weights, or per-synapse scaling factors.  The `Pattern` interface does not define any standard for how this done, as there are various possible approaches.  Circle defines a method with a standard signature that can be called for each point in the pattern, while PoolTile has a lot more overhead per point and is thus more efficient to generate the whole set of weights to tensor, which can then be used.

It is recommended to have some kind of positive flag(s) for enabling the use of TopoWts -- the standard weight initialization methods, e.g., leabra.Network.InitWts, can then automatically do the correct thing for each type of standard projection -- custom ones outside of this standard set would need custom code..
